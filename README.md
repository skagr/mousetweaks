Mouse tweaks for Windows
========================

OSX-like mouse behaviour for MS Windows:
- Reverses mouse wheel scroll direction
- Scrolls windows under mouse, even if inactive

Requirements
------------
Autohotkey installed on PATH

Building
--------
build.bat creates a standalone executable version of MouseTweaks. Note that the script works just fine without this, except you don't get the Mickey icon. Requires Ahk2Exe in a Tools directory above current (adjust batchfile accordingly)
